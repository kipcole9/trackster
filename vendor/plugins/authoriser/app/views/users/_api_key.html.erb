<h4>Your API Key is <em><%= api_key %></em>.</h4>
<p>This key can be used to authenticate your access to the system as an alternative
to your login and password. This is very useful in the case of API access. You 
  should treat this key as securely as your password.  Anyone with this key can access
  the system as if they were you.</p>
<p>You can generate a new API key at any time.  However doing so will invalidate your
old API Key which may disrupt system access for any applications you manage that
rely on your API key.</p>
