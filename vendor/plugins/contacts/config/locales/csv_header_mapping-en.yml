# Basic import strategy (for all file types) is to convert the content to
# VCard format and then delegate the actual import to Vcard::Import
# We aim to cover the full set of field names as exported by Outlook, Outlook Express, Apple Addressbook
# and later on SFDC, ACT! and so on.  The idea is to get rid of the usual manual field
# mapping.
