Building a new server.

1.  Update chef gem
2.  Building the hosts file fails the first time.  Fix that.
3.  Building nginx from source starts the nginx service.  We don't always want that - fix it.


App stuff

2.	After login (forced) should redirect back to the page they requested


Table formatter

*	Arguments to formatters that are merged into options at execution.  Add no_set_on_blank and
unknown_on_blank as arguments to numeric formatters

*	Add linkability to formatters.  Need to work out how to specify the url such that can plug in 
relevant parameters?


Templates

*	Collapse into one template for the site

*	Ajax loading of page content (hijack links and ajax load)


Issues

*	Print button in IE7 (looks like javascript not working)

*	Click map - better way to highlight no links?

*	Graphs not appears in IE (javascript)

*	Account dropdown

*	Documentation
