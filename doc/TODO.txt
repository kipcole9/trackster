Building a new server.

1.  Update chef gem
2.  Building the hosts file fails the first time.  Fix that.
3.  Building nginx from source starts the nginx service.  We don't always want that - fix it.

Shared stuff

1. Do 'exportfs -a' after updating exports
2. Template /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server since its not right (fails startup test)
3. Use this directory for tmp uploaded files so they can be shared.  Store in an account-based directory

App stuff

1.  Set sessions cookies to the domain (not subdomain) since users can access multiple accounts
2.	After login (forced) should redirect back to the page they requested

Graphing

1.  Highcharts 2.1 beta implementation - use css_rule to drive colours

Rules
====
var sheet= document.styleSheets[0];
alert(sheet.cssRules[0].cssText);
//var rules= 'cssRules' in sheet ? sheet.cssRules : sheet.rules;
//for (var i= 0; i<rules.length; i++) {
//    var rule= rules[i];
//   var text= 'cssText' in rule? rule.cssText : rule.selectorText+' //{'+rule.style.cssText+'}';
//    alert(text);
//}
