Building a new server.

1.  Update chef gem
2.  Building the hosts file fails the first time.  Fix that.
3.  Building nginx from source starts the nginx service.  We don't always want that - fix it.


App stuff

2.	After login (forced) should redirect back to the page they requested - set redirect cookie
