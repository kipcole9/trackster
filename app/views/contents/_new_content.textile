h4. Source Tab: URL or File Upload

Your content can be uploaded from another web site or from a local file on your computer.  You should only select web site OR local file - not both.

Enter the URL where your content can be found.  The content should be in HTML format.

h6. File

Enter the path to the file on your local computer.

h4. Base URL

Some content contains relative URLs such as '/images/banner.jpg' which do not specify the host where the image is stored.  You can specify a base URL here that will be prepended to all relative URLs to ensure maximum content fidelity in your emails.  Your content can also specify a &lt;base&gt; tag in the header section of your document.  Any URL you enter here will override a &lt;base&gt; tag in your document.
